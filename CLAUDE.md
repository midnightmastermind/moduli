## Handoff — 2026-07-07 LATE-3 (occurrence FEEDS shipped — Table:/Canvas: Build ops replaced)

**Feeds are live.** `occurrence.feed = { enabled, conditions, roles, scope, sort, limit }` on any
container or page = a declarative materialized FIND: matching sources (filter-menu conditions +
the owner's effective date cascade) are minted as COPY-LINKED children (`meta.feedSourceId`,
drag-locked to copy), alongside the owner's own children. Engine: `helpers/feedSync.js`
(scan-based self-healing diff, mint/sweep/re-link, accumulated parent ref, fireTrigger:false +
markDerivedOcc echo suppression), scheduled debounced from bindSocketToStore. Trackers exclude
feed copies (`meta.feedSourceId IS_EMPTY` in makeTrackerOp + inline trackers) so feeds can't
double-count. UI: `ui/FeedSection.jsx` in container/page header menus. `Table: Build` +
`Canvas: Build` seed ops DELETED (68 ops now) — Schedule Table (child-occurrence ROWS, new generic
ContainerTable rendering; Goal column dropped) + Schedule Canvas (center-stacked fallback
positions) carry seeded feeds and now INHERIT the date cascade. Verified headless: both pages
materialize today's 6 tasks; reload = zero-write no-op; orphan/dupe self-heals. 12 engine tests;
1212/1212 client + 227/227 server; reseeded. Spec + as-built record:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-07-occurrence-feed-plan.md` (v1 limits listed there).

## Handoff — 2026-07-07 LATE-2 (trackers fixed both orders + notifications overhaul + behavioral test suite + delete-recount fix)

Continuation of the `.claude`-account session (hit its limit mid-edit of createLiveData). All on
`audit-fixes-dnd-wrap-menus`, 4 commits. **Root cause shipped**: tracker ops only had
container-role onAdd/onDelete triggers — instance drops into Schedule slots never re-aggregated.
Every makeTrackerOp now registers the instance-role pair; the `isTask` marker field is REMOVED
(no-hardcoding rule) in favor of the generic `presenceFieldId` (IS_NOT_EMPTY) discriminator
(Pomodoros→pomodoroNumber, Total Workouts→muscleGroup — Workouts was counting water logs).
Verified BOTH orders headless + as tests (complete→drop bumps on the DROP; drop→complete on the
toggle). **Second real bug found & fixed**: deletes never decremented trackers — the delete
snapshot rode `occurrencesOverride` back into executor state (recount still counted the deleted
item). Now the snapshot rides ON the transaction (`_occurrenceSnapshot`, trigger-context only);
override plumbing removed end-to-end.

**Notifications**: op pills carry actual results ("Monthly Bills: Amount→2040.97", "+2 Stretching",
per-item Days Until Due) via `helpers/opResultSummary.js`, shared across all three fire sites
(the drop-move site previously swallowed successes AND failures). Drag toasts name the destination
with page context ("Moved X: Finance & Admin → Schedule › 3:00am (#1)") via a structural
page-ancestor walk; doc-embed drag-outs toast too.

**Behavioral audit is now a test suite** (`client/src/__tests__/liveOpsBehavioral.test.js`, 18
tests): boots the executor on the exported seed (server/seed/*.json), replays the onLoad sweep,
fires real transactions for EVERY input type (boolean/number/duration/select/amount+flow/reps) +
drops/deletes + a multi-day picker selection rebuilding the Schedule (3 day-cols), asserting
tracker VALUES read from each op's own pipeline targets. `datePickerSelection.test.js` locks the
single/range/multi/week/month/year classifier rules. Picker: today-hint is now much lighter than
selection (user ask). Quote artifacts render 13px = doc body. **DnD matrix audit** delivered:
`docs/dnd-matrix-2026-07-07.md`. **Feed plan** (occurrence-menu feed pulling occurrences by
filter-menu conditions) written + soundness-reviewed, NOT implemented — awaiting user review:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-07-occurrence-feed-plan.md` (3 open questions at the bottom).
1200/1200 client + 227/227 server, build clean, live grid reseeded (probe writes swept).

---

## Handoff — 2026-07-07 LATE (image picker shipped + options-resolver fix + grid sweep)

Continuation of account2's session (hit spend limit mid-verify). **ImagePickerMenu** (Calibre-style
Search/Upload/URL image lookup) shipped and wired into occurrence-dropdown option rows, media-role
field pills, and the artifact image viewer; server proxy routes `/api/images/search` (DDG+Wikipedia)
+ `/api/images/upload` (bare upload). Verification surfaced + fixed two latent optionsResolver bugs
that had EVERY ancestor-scoped occurrence dropdown resolving to zero options (`$record.` prefix not
stripped in `resolveRecordPath`; `_ancestors` never enriched in `buildCollection`). 1162/1162 client
+ 222/222 server tests, build clean, e2e verified headless (Account dropdown → options → Set image →
URL commit). **Live grid reseeded + probe writes surgically removed.** Also per user: stale unnamed
2×3 skeleton grid deleted (again — recurrence of 2026-07-04) and `createLiveData` now auto-sweeps
dead skeleton grids on every default reseed (`sweepStaleGrids`); exactly 2 grids remain (Live Grid +
the 1×1 empty scratch grid). Queued (from account2, user notes mid-session): **goals overhaul —
"full representation of everything tracked/goaled, trackers included; extreme granularity is the
bar"** (task #9 successor).

---

## Handoff — 2026-07-06 (branch `audit-fixes-dnd-wrap-menus`, all 14 plan tasks shipped)

The full 14-task audit-fix plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-06-dnd-wrap-menus-audit-fixes.md`)
is implemented and committed on `audit-fixes-dnd-wrap-menus` (not merged to master yet).
1154/1154 client + 222/222 server tests, build clean, **live data reseeded** after the perf probes.

Shipped: InsertGap crash fix (Task 1) · drop-path debug logs gated behind `__dragPerf`/`__dragDiag`
(2) · RadialMenu dead-prop cleanup (3) · ContextMenu 70vh scroll + flexible width (4) · QuickAddMenu
flip-above (5) · importer drops dead `wrap`/`anchor` attrs (6) · **line-level wraps clip/classify the
correct band** via new `wrapAnchor.hasMidAnchor`/`classifyWrapShape` (7) · Editor dragover math
rAF-throttled (8) · member-card scan shared + cached (9) · **dragSystem live-ref payloads — no
JSON.stringify deps, no listener re-registration on occurrence writes** (10, the perf core) ·
MobileGridNav scrollable-ancestor once per gesture (11) · touch pill shows Move/Copy/Copy-link (12) ·
mouse drags on touch-primary devices with a touch-dragstart guard (13 — **needs a real-tablet check**;
revert just that commit if Android long-press still starts a native ghost) · drop→paint re-baselined
(14): median 1742ms → 1378ms @5x throttle; still >600ms, so a **"drop frame-1 flush profiling"
docket entry** is filed in `client/src/CLAUDE.md` (separate session).

**2026-07-06 LATE-3 (`b6a98e14`):** computedValues moved off GridLiveContext to a per-key
`state/computedValuesStore` (all consumers migrated, 1159/1159 tests). A/B drop probe proved the
frame-1 flush is **NOT computedValues-driven** (pre 1750ms / post 1831ms median @5x, identical
render counts) — that hypothesis is closed; component-level profiler attribution is the remaining
frame-1 lever (docket updated). Migration kept for the drain-wave render win. Live grid reseeded.

**2026-07-07:** frame-1 flush ATTRIBUTED (new gated `__RENDER_ATTR` probe) and largely fixed —
drop→paint median **1750ms → 1066ms @5x**, renders 183/156/535 → 54/~10/~2. Three causes:
preview cards re-rendering inside every write's commit (PreviewNode now polls the state snapshot,
500ms deduped), `addInstanceToContainer` identity churn (now stateRef at call time), and
**use-context-selector phantom renders** — GridActionsContext rewritten to a per-provider store +
`useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector` (public API unchanged; 1159/1159 tests; headless field-edit +
drag/drop smoke verified). Docket stays open for the residual (~54 slot-container renders, op
drain). Live grid reseeded after probing.

~~Queued next (CLAUDE_CHAT 2026-07-06): "look into dropping in a doc, and doc container, especially
nested ones. the drop was reloading the entire page"~~ — **DONE 2026-07-06 LATE.** Traced with
`__dragDiag` probes: not a reload, not double-handling — the page editor owned every doc drop and
its nearest top-level boundary hoisted the item to the TOP of the page (source list lost it =
"the page reset"). Fixed: nested doc-container editors register delegate-only drop zones; the page
editor + touch routing hand them drops landing inside (`getDocTouchDropZone`). Verified headless on
desktop + touch; embeds persist in the NESTED container's textmap. See ui/ + helpers/ CLAUDE.md.
Follow-up polish: page-level gap indicator still draws during dragover over a nested container.

## Test checklist — 2026-05-20

Re-seed live data first: `node --env-file=.env server/scripts/createLiveData.js`.
Test results last refresh: **37 files / 731 tests passing** (see `test-results.txt`).

### Multi-day Schedule (carryover from earlier this session)
- [ ] Single-day view renders byte-identical to the pre-refactor single-day Schedule
- [ ] Pick a 3-day range in the date picker → 3 day-columns appear, shared slot containers multi-parented into each
- [ ] Pick week / month / year via picker → format flips between `timeslot` (≤7 days, columns side-by-side) and `shortened` (>7 days, wrapped grid)
- [ ] Drag a task into one day's column → task appears only in that day, slot persists
- [ ] Switch back to single-day → no data loss; instances still on their original dates
- [ ] Tracker totals aggregate across the active period (`$activePeriodDates` / `$activePeriodCount`)

### Editor↔field bindings (BoundHeader / BoundBody)
- [ ] Container header bound to a select field with options → dropdown renders inline; pick value → fires write + propagates via link field
- [ ] Textblock body bound to a text field → typing in editor debounce-commits + syncs siblings
- [ ] Link badge in top-right of bound editor shows the bound field name; tooltip reads `Linked: <field name>`
- [ ] Daily Question container in day-page template → click 🎲 dice → random question loads; answer textblock writes back to today's instance

### Multi-select + paste (shipped this session)
- [ ] Shift+click an instance → selection chip overlay highlights it
- [ ] Shift+click more instances → count grows; right-click any selected one shows bulk items at top
- [ ] Choose "Copy N selected" → right-click target container → "Paste N here" mints fresh occurrences with same moduleId → **toast "Pasted N items"** appears for 2s
- [ ] Choose "Move N selected" → right-click target → "Move N here" re-parents (no fresh occurrences; originals move) → **toast "Moved N items"** appears
- [ ] Choose "Copy-link N selected" → right-click target → "Paste linked N here" mints fresh occurrences sharing `linkedGroupId`; toggling a field in one ticks the others → **toast "Linked N items"** appears
- [ ] Paste-here also surfaces on a page right-click (destination is the page occurrence)
- [ ] Self-paste (target = source) is silently skipped
- [ ] **Delete N selected** prompts `confirm(...)` with the count; cancel aborts; confirm deletes

### Canvas connect tool (shipped this session)
- [ ] Open any canvas page → toolbar shows new chain-link icon between Hand and Pen
- [ ] Click connect → cursor switches to crosshair
- [ ] Press on card A, drag a dashed bezier, release on card B → solid bezier persists
- [ ] Reload → connection still there (persisted to `pageOccurrence.meta.edges`)
- [ ] Move either card → bezier follows
- [ ] In connect mode, click on an edge → deletes it
- [ ] **Delete a card connected by an edge** → on the next canvas paint, the orphaned edge is cleaned from `meta.edges` (lazy persist)
- [ ] Switching to any other tool → edges still render but become click-through (no accidental deletion)
- [ ] Drawing tools, drop targets, world pan, mobile toolbar, autoscroll still all work in their respective modes
- [ ] **Undo (Undo button)** undoes both edge additions AND edge deletions (mixed with strokes — most recent action regardless of type)
- [ ] **Redo** replays the undone action

### Multi-select deep-paste (added in review fixups)
- [ ] Shift-select a CONTAINER with children → Copy → paste into another container → new container appears with copies of all its children (not an empty shell)
- [ ] Pasted children preserve fields + iteration mode from source
- [ ] **Copy-link a container with children** → paste into another container → toggling a field in the new linked container's child propagates back to the source's matching child (per-pair linked groups)
- [ ] Move-mode on a container still re-parents the existing container (children come along because they're parented to it)
- [ ] **Shallow paste preserves iterationMode** — copy a persistent leaf instance; the new occurrence is still persistent (not silently demoted to specific)
- [ ] **Canvas edges anchor at card center** even for tall containers — edges land mid-card instead of 30px below the top

### Socket status pill (shipped this session)
- [ ] Throttle Network → Offline in DevTools → red pulsing pill appears right of logo: "Disconnected — retrying (N)" with N incrementing
- [ ] Hover the pill → tooltip explains writes are buffered locally
- [ ] Edit a field / drag a card while offline → no error toasts, no UI freeze
- [ ] Throttle back to Online → green "Reconnected" pill for ~3s → fades to nothing
- [ ] Buffered changes have synced server-side after the pill fades

## Handoff — Session 2026-05-20 → Next session

Multi-day Schedule shipped (hybrid architecture: shared slots persist under Schedule, day-col wrappers come/go via multi-parent — zero data loss). New picker (react-multi-date-picker) supports single/range/multi/week/month/year. `$activePeriodDates` + `$activePeriodCount` available in op pipelines. Container-in-container primitive via `module.meta.allowChildContainers`. Test grid byte-identical to before (uses original `makeScheduleBuildDayOp`); live data uses new `makeScheduleBuildScheduleOp`. **Re-seed live data required to test:** `node --env-file=.env scripts/createLiveData.js`.

### Testing feedback fixes (in progress this session)

User tested the multi-day Schedule and reported:
- ✅ Hourly chime disabled (was firing every second — `lastFiredAt` sync race; see `state/useScheduler.js` debug TODO).
- ✅ **Build Schedule perf (d)** — Phase 4 was `LOOP $allContainers` PER day. Refactored to Phase 4a (one-time slot ID collection via PUSH_TO_VAR) + Phase 4b (per-day ADD_CHILD from precomputed list). Cuts from O(days × containers) to O(containers + days × slots).
- ✅ **(a) Multi-day rendering polish** — `client/src/modules/pages/PageBoard.jsx` now detects `meta.scheduleDayColumn` children and (1) hides `meta.scheduleSlot` / `meta.scheduleDueContainer` from page-level render (they're multi-parented into day-cols), (2) switches to horizontal `flex-direction: row` with 280-360px min/max width per column when ≥2 day-cols exist. Single day-col still renders vertically (looks like the original single-day Schedule).
- 🟡 **(b) Goals restructure — Stage 1 done, Stage 2 pending.**
  - **Stage 1 (done):** `makeTrackerOp` in `server/utils/liveSystemBuilders.js` accepts a new `goalOccurrenceId` param. When provided, the goal-lookup step replaces FIND-by-label with `INIT_VAR $goalId = literal:<id>` + `FIND $allItems where id IS $goalId → $goalItem`. Back-compat: legacy `goalLabel`-only callers still work (test grid + currently-unique-label goals in createLiveData).
  - **Stage 2 (pending — user direction needed):** User said "i dont like label compare", "use the category picker to pick a specific occurrence", "i just dont want to write out the id in the operation", "we have grab direct ref" — the seed should use whatever the UI's CategoryPathPicker outputs for an occurrence pick, NOT a literal id baked into the op. CategoryPathPicker outputs are dotted paths like `$<var>.<path>` resolved via `resolveExpr`. For occurrences, no id-indexed map exists in the executor today — there's `$allItems` (array), `$allInstances`, etc. but no `$allItemsById`. Two paths forward:
    - (a) **Add `$allItemsById` to executor** — plain object `{ [id]: item }` exposed in $vars. Reference syntax `$allItemsById.<id>`. Picker emits that path. Tracker's $goalItem = `$allItemsById.<id>` via INIT_VAR with expr. Note: UUIDs contain `-` which probably trips dot-notation path resolver — may need `["<id>"]` bracket-notation support or use a hash-friendly id format.
    - (b) **Deterministic IDs** for seed-stable occurrences (goal items, schedule slots) — generate via hash of stable key like `goalOcc("physical-water")` instead of random `uid()`. Op embeds the deterministic id as literal; survives re-seed because same key → same id. More invasive but eliminates the resolver question.
  - Recommendation: (a) is the smaller change. Implement `$allItemsById` in `operationExecutor.js:1172` area, verify path resolver handles UUIDs (probably needs bracket notation: `$allItemsById["abc-123-def"]`). Then Stage 3: actually split the multi-field goalInstances entries + update tracker call sites in createLiveData.
  - **Why deferred this session:** This needs careful integration with the picker UI's existing output format. Picking the wrong reference shape means an executor change AND a picker change later. Best done in a focused session that touches `CategoryPathPicker.jsx`, `operationExecutor.js`, `liveSystemBuilders.js`, and `createLiveData.js` together.
- ⏳ **(c) Picker redesign** — user wants calendar-style with zoom drilldown (month grid → year grid). Current `react-multi-date-picker` UX doesn't match. See memory `project-pending-features` for options.

Other already-queued items below (folder-page defaults, Pomodoro, GET_USER_INPUT, multi-select, mindmap) remain valid.

### Next steps (in order)

1. **User re-seeds + verifies multi-day Schedule end-to-end** — open Schedule, try single-day (should look exactly like before), then pick a 3-day range / week. Day-cols should appear; instances persist across view changes; trackers aggregate over the period.
2. **D1(a) op rename** — strip "Tracker:" prefix from local createLiveData ops (now redundant with `opCategoryIds.trackers` folder). About 27 ops. Update `waterTrackerName` + `completedTrackerName` params passed to `makeScheduleBuildScheduleOp`. Test grid untouched.
3. **Folder-page defaults for Daily Toolkit + Center Hub panels** — see memory `project-pending-features`. Set the panels' default view to a folder-page (card grid of child pages) instead of a single tab. ~30 lines per panel in createLiveData.
4. **Pomodoro → Schedule** — see memory `project-pending-features`. Pomodoro template instance in Daily Toolkit, Pomodoro goal (3/day), trackers (current pomo + time + history), 3 ops (Start / Complete / Stop) firing from PomodoroTimer.jsx.
5. **Month view page** — see memory `project-pending-features`. Separate page kind with 30 day-containers, no slots. Own `Build Month` op constrained to month-unit filter. Bidirectional with Schedule (drag-into-month creates task w/ null timeslot, picks slot later via select).
6. **GET_USER_INPUT op action** — see memory `project-pending-features`. General-purpose action that opens a modal asking the user for input; chained THENs ask follow-up questions; each step's result lands in `$vars` for downstream steps.
7. **Multi-select system** — see memory `project-multiselect-plan`. Shift+click, shift+arrow tree-walking, rubber-band drag, ContextMenu with copy/move/edit/copylink, paste-here on empty space, radial menu mode icon. Multi-session implementation.
8. ~~**Canvas mindmap (React Flow)**~~ — **DONE 2026-05-20** as a tool added to the existing canvas (not a new page kind, no React Flow). New `connect` tool in `CanvasContent.jsx` lets the user drag from one card to another to draw a bezier edge. Edges persist on `containerOccurrence.meta.edges = [{ id, from, to }]`. SVG overlay sized to the world (4000×4000); clicking an edge in connect mode deletes it. Plays clean with every existing canvas feature (drawing tools, drop targets, world pan, autoscroll, mobile toolbar, filters). `@xyflow/react` removed from package.json. See memory `project-canvas-mindmap-plan` (now slightly out of date — edges live on the page occurrence the same way, but no separate kind exists).
9. ~~**Socket connection status indicator in grid header**~~ — **DONE 2026-05-20**. `hooks/useSocketStatus.js` subscribes to `connect` / `disconnect` / `connect_error` / `reconnect_attempt` and returns `{ status: "connected" | "disconnected" | "recovered", attempts }`. `ui/SocketStatusBanner.jsx` renders an inline pill in the toolbar (right of the logo) — red w/ pulsing dot + "Disconnected — retrying (N)" while down, green + "Reconnected" briefly when restored, nothing when normal. Tooltip on the red pill spells out that writes are buffered (offline queue already handles the buffering — this is just visibility). Pulse keyframe `socket-status-pulse` added to `index.css`. Tied through socket lifecycle events; queue replay continues to happen elsewhere (App.jsx-level on full_state).
9.5. **Offline-queue-aware "Reconnected" fade** — the green pill currently fades after a fixed 3s regardless of whether buffered writes have been server-acknowledged. `flushOfflineQueue` empties the local queue synchronously on reconnect, but the server-roundtrip ack is unknown. Tighten by: (a) capturing pre-flush queue length, (b) listening for the next N entity-updated events from the server, (c) holding the pill until those land or a 10s upper cap fires. Cosmetic — the existing 3s works for typical session lengths.

10. **Assistant LLM chatbox (last item)** — design + spec out an in-app assistant that can perform real actions through a conversational chatbox: create operations (full pipeline w/ trigger + steps), create occurrences/modules/containers/pages, attach fields, navigate filters, save templates, run ops on demand, explain why an op didn't fire, etc. **Read `docs/aispecs.md` first** — the user has a written-out spec there covering the offline LLM stack (Ollama + qwen2.5-coder / deepseek-coder), tool router pattern, sandboxed command executor, OCR layer, and a "frog Jeeves" persona. The plan should incorporate (or supersede) that doc, not duplicate it. The API layer should be a first-class part of the plan — likely a thin Express/route layer on the server that the local LLM (or a hosted Anthropic SDK fallback) calls through, with each tool mapping to a CommitHelpers function or operation-action effect (CREATE, UPDATE, APPLY_TEMPLATE, RUN_OPERATION, etc.). Probably a side-drawer or floating panel that wraps the tool-use loop. Will need: (a) a curated tool catalog with JSON schemas mirroring our pipeline action shapes, (b) state snapshotting so the LLM sees the current grid/modules/fields/operations, (c) confirmation UX before destructive actions, (d) prompt caching against the static system prompt + tool catalog. This is the BIG ticket — full plan to be drafted at the end of the queue.

## Older handoffs

Sessions earlier than the past week are archived in [`docs/handoffs/`](./docs/handoffs/):

- [`2026-05-11.md`](./docs/handoffs/2026-05-11.md) — drag-and-drop punch-list
- [`2026-05-11-late.md`](./docs/handoffs/2026-05-11-late.md) — textblock/canvas thread + carryover (all resolved 2026-05-12)

Consult the archive only if the active sections above don't cover something. New session work should treat the latest dated handoff as authoritative — older direction is superseded.

## Claude Session Directives (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

### Token Efficiency — Read Less, Do More
- **Check folder-level `CLAUDE.md` files FIRST** before re-reading source files. Every folder I've touched has a `CLAUDE.md` with a file map and recent changes summary. Use it.
- **Never re-read a file you already touched this session** unless the user explicitly changed it. Track what you've modified.
- **When you touch files in a folder**, update/create that folder's `CLAUDE.md` with the changes made, so future sessions don't re-read the source.
- Key folders with CLAUDE.md: `client/src/`, `client/src/ui/`, `client/src/helpers/`, `client/src/state/`, `server/`
- Memory files are at: `/home/joshpoms/.claude/projects/-home-joshpoms-dndtest2/memory/`

### Pragmatic Programmer Philosophy (ALWAYS APPLY)
- **DRY** — Don't Repeat Yourself. Every piece of knowledge has a single authoritative source. No duplicate logic.
- **Orthogonality** — Keep modules independent. A change in DragProvider shouldn't require changes in ContextMenu.
- **ETC (Easier to Change)** — Design for changeability. Prefer patterns that are easy to modify over ones that are prematurely clever.
- **Tracer Bullets** — Build end-to-end thin slices first, then fatten. Wire Panel → Context → Socket → Reducer before polishing UI.
- **Don't Live with Broken Windows** — Fix bad designs immediately. Don't patch on top of wrong abstractions.
- **The Boyscout Rule** — Leave code cleaner than you found it. Small improvements add up.
- **Contracts (interfaces)** — Each module has a clear public contract. CommitHelpers is the only layer that talks to socket. Components never call socket directly.
- **Power of Plain Text** — Data in plain, portable formats. No magic string formats that only one place understands.
- **Don't Outrun Your Headlights** — Implement one phase at a time. Don't spec Phase 9 while Phase 6 is incomplete.
- **Good Enough Software** — Ship working features before polishing. Don't let perfect block good.

### Session Rules
- Each time you touch files in a folder, update that folder's `CLAUDE.md`
- Start each session by reading `MEMORY.md` and relevant folder `CLAUDE.md` files — not source files
- At 80% context: stop new features, wrap up current task, update MEMORY.md
- At 90% context: only review/cleanup — no new work
- Always leave system in a testable state (`npm run dev` must work)

## How the Data Works

### Server (MongoDB via Mongoose)

There are two things stored in the DB for every piece of content: a **Module** and an **Occurrence**.

**Module** is the template — it defines what something is. It has a `role` (panel, container, instance) and a `kind` (list, doc, artifact, board). For file-backed content it also has a `fileRef` path (e.g. `notes/morenotes.md`). Modules don't store position, order, or any per-session state. They are reusable.

**Occurrence** is the placement — it's what actually appears on screen. Every occurrence points at a module via `targetId`. It stores:
- `fields: {}` — field values for this specific placement (e.g. how many reps you did *today* in *this context*)
- `textmap` — TipTap JSON for rich text containers/artifacts
- `parentId` — which parent occurrence or folder this lives inside
- `occurrences: [ids]` — ordered list of child occurrence IDs (this is how ordering works — NOT on the module)
- `viewId` — points to a View record (only when this occurrence needs rendering config)
- `iteration` — time filter + category filter + persistence mode

**View** is a separate record. Occurrences that need rendering config (e.g. a panel showing an artifact file tree) have a `viewId` that points here. View stores `viewType`, `hasTree`, `manifestId`, `activeOccurrenceId`, `layout`. Modules have no viewId — only occurrences do.

**Manifest + Folder** handle the file tree sidebar. A Manifest has a `rootFolderId`. Folders form a tree via `parentId`. Artifact occurrences place themselves in the tree by setting `parentId = folderId`.

**Field** records define what data an instance can collect (number, text, boolean, select, date, duration, rating). Fields are shared templates — instances bind to them via `fieldBindings`.

**Operation** records define automation pipelines. Each has a `pipeline: { sources, steps }` where steps are a top-down code flow: INIT_VAR → LOOP → IF → ADD_TO_VAR → SHOW_VALUE. No black-box aggregations — the math is explicit.

```
Grid
 └── occurrences: [panelOccId, ...]       grid owns the panel occurrence IDs

Panel Occurrence  (viewId → View or null)
 ├── targetId → Module [role: "panel"]
 └── occurrences: [containerOccId, ...]

Container Occurrence  (textmap if kind=doc/artifact)
 ├── targetId → Module [role: "container", kind: "list"|"doc"|"artifact"|"board"]
 └── occurrences: [instanceOccId, ...]

Instance Occurrence
 ├── targetId → Module [role: "instance"]
 └── fields: { fieldId: { value, flow } }

Artifact Panel → View { viewType:"artifact", hasTree:true, manifestId }
  Manifest → rootFolder → Folder children
    └── Artifact Occurrence (parentId = folderId)
         ├── targetId → Module [kind: "artifact", fileRef: "notes/x.md"]
         └── textmap: TipTap JSON  (synced to artifacts/notes/x.md on save)
```

### Client (React + Socket.io)

On connect the server sends `full_state` — a flat dump of all modules, occurrences, views, manifests, folders, fields, operations, computedValues for the user's grid. The client stores these in Redux-like state maps (`modulesById`, `occurrencesById`, `viewsById`, etc.).

**Rendering**: `Grid.jsx` reads the grid's occurrence list, renders a `modules/Panel` for each panel occurrence. Panel reads its child occurrence IDs, renders `modules/Container` for each. Container renders `modules/Instance` for each instance occurrence. If the panel occurrence has a viewId pointing to an artifact view, Panel renders `modules/View` which shows `ManifestTree` sidebar + `modules/Artifact` content.

**Mutations**: Everything goes through `CommitHelpers.js` — the only place that calls `socket.emit`. Components call CommitHelper functions, which dispatch to local state immediately (optimistic) and emit to server. Server persists and broadcasts to other windows.

**Operations**: Triggered by field changes, drops, or iteration changes. `bindSocketToStore.js` catches the trigger event, calls `executePipeline` in `operationExecutor.js`, which runs LOOP/IF/action steps and returns effects. Effects (SET_FIELD_VALUE, SHOW_VALUE, etc.) are applied via CommitHelpers. `computedValues` in state holds display field outputs keyed by `[occurrenceId][fieldId]`. `FieldRenderer` reads from computedValues when `field.displayEnabled`.

**Drag**: `DragProvider.jsx` handles all drag events. Copy = new occurrence with same targetId. Move = update occurrence.parentId + reorder parent.occurrences array. Doc container drop = insert pill at cursor position in TipTap editor.

### Field Values and Flow

Field values are stored as `{ value, flow }` where flow is `"in"`, `"out"`, or `"replace"`. Operations loop over occurrences and aggregate based on flow direction — `"out"` values are negated (expenses, time lost). This lets you have one `amount` field serve both income and expenses in the same operation.

### Module Kinds
| Kind | What it renders | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| `list` | Drag-sortable instance list | Default |
| `doc` | TipTap rich text editor | Field pills, instance embeds |
| `board` | Containers as columns | Kanban-style |
| `artifact` | File content by viewType | Markdown / image / PDF / audio / video |

### Transactions (Audit Trail)

Every change produces a **Transaction** record. Transaction types:

- **MeasureOp** — a field value changed on an occurrence: who (instance), what (field + value), where (container context), when (timestamp)
- **OccurrenceListOp** — an occurrence moved from one container to another: captures source/destination and a field snapshot at the time of move
- **EntityOp** — a module was created, updated, or deleted
- **DocEditOp** — a doc container's textmap changed (TipTap steps)

Transactions have a `state` field: `"applied"`, `"undone"`, or `"redone"`. Undo/redo flips the state and re-applies or reverses the change. The full history is queryable — you can ask "what was the value of this field last Tuesday?" by replaying transactions up to a point.

### Iterations (Time + Category Filtering)

**Iterations** control what data each occurrence "belongs to". Every occurrence has an `iteration` object:

```
iteration: {
  timeFilter: "daily" | "weekly" | "monthly" | "yearly" | "all"
  timeValue:  Date   — specific date/week/month this occurrence is pinned to
  categoryKey: String  — e.g. "context" (optional)
  categoryValue: Mixed — e.g. "work" (optional)
  mode: "persistent" | "specific" | "untilDone"
}
```

**Modes:**
- `persistent` — shows in every iteration (e.g. a recurring habit)
- `specific` — only shows on a particular date/week
- `untilDone` — shows until its `completionFieldId` field goes truthy

**Grid.iterations** defines named iteration configurations (e.g. "Daily Work", "Weekly Personal"). Each has a `timeFilter` and optional `categoryKey`. The grid has a `selectedIterationId` and `currentIterationValue` (the active date/week/month). Panels, containers, and instances can each `inherit` the parent's iteration or set their `own`. This cascades: Grid → Panel → Container → Instance.

**IterationNav** (Toolbar) lets you advance the global time position (prev/next day, week, etc.). Panels with `mode: "own"` show their own local arrows independently.

### Templates

Modules are already templates — the same module can have many occurrences in different places. But there's also an explicit **Templates** feature:

- `grid.templates: [{ id, name, moduleIds, occurrenceIds }]` — saved workspace snapshots
- `save_template` socket event — captures a container (+ its instances) as a reusable template
- `fill_from_template` socket event — stamps a new set of occurrences from the template into a target container
- Templates let you define a "Morning Routine" layout once, then stamp it into any time slot on any day
- Drag a saved template from the Command Center into any container to fill it

## Compound Iteration System (Phase 4 Enhancement)

### Current State
The system uses `occurrence.iteration` with:
- `key: "time"` - time-based filtering
- `value: Date` - specific date
- `mode: "persistent" | "specific" | "untilDone"`

### Enhanced Design: Compound Iterations

Iterations can be BOTH time-based AND category-based simultaneously. Categories work like tags/contexts that can filter independently of time.

**Enhanced Schema:**
```javascript
// Occurrence iteration
iteration: {
  // Primary axis: time (always present)
  timeKey: { type: String, default: "time" },
  timeValue: { type: Date },
  timeFilter: { type: String, enum: ["daily", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly", "all"] },

  // Secondary axis: category (optional)
  categoryKey: { type: String },    // "context", "project", "area", null
  categoryValue: { type: Mixed },   // "work", "personal", ["health", "fitness"], null

  // Persistence mode (applies to both axes)
  mode: { type: String, enum: ["persistent", "specific", "untilDone"] },

  // Completion tracking (for untilDone mode)
  completedOn: { type: Date },
  completionFieldId: { type: String },
}

// Grid iteration definitions (user-configured)
Grid.iterations: [{
  id: String,
  name: String,                     // "Daily Work", "Weekly Personal"
  timeFilter: String,               // "daily", "weekly", etc.
  categoryKey: String,              // "context", "project", or null
  categoryOptions: [String],        // ["work", "personal", "health"]
}]

Grid.selectedIterationId: String,   // Current iteration definition
Grid.currentTimeValue: Date,        // Current time position
Grid.currentCategoryValue: Mixed,   // Current category filter (or null for all)
```

### Cascading Iterations

Iteration settings can be overwritten as you go down the hierarchy:

```
Grid: Daily + All Categories
  └─ Panel (inherit): Daily + All Categories
      └─ Container (own: Work only): Daily + Work
          └─ Instance (inherit): Daily + Work
  └─ Panel (own: Weekly): Weekly + All Categories
      └─ Container (inherit): Weekly + All Categories
```

**Key Principle**: Each level can either:
- `inherit` - Use parent's iteration settings
- `own` - Override with specific settings

### Local Iteration Navigation

Each panel/container with `mode: "own"` can have its own iteration arrows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Schedule Panel                    [⚙️]  │
│ ◀ Mon, Feb 10  [📅] ▶   [Work ▼]       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  • 9:00am Meeting                       │
│  • 10:00am Code review                  │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The panel can navigate its own iteration independently of the grid's global iteration.

### Use Cases

1. **Daily Schedule + Work Context**: See only work items for today
2. **Weekly Goals + Personal**: See personal goals for this week
3. **Panel with Different Time**: Grid is daily, but one panel shows weekly view
4. **Category-Only Filter**: Same day, but filtered to "Health" context

### Running the App
```bash
# Development (runs client + server)
npm run dev

# Reset sample data
cd server && node scripts/resetData.js
```

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `client/src/helpers/DragProvider.jsx` | Drag state coordinator |
| `client/src/helpers/CalculationHelpers.js` | All calculation/aggregation logic |
| `client/src/helpers/CommitHelpers.js` | CRUD operations |

| `client/src/docs/` | Rich text editor & pills |
| `server/models/Occurrence.js` | Occurrence schema with iteration |
| `server/models/Transaction.js` | Audit trail schema |

### Architecture Patterns
- **Occurrence-based**: Entities are templates, occurrences are placements
- **Session refs**: Immediate state access during async operations
- **Flow values**: `{ value, flow: "in"|"out"|"replace" }` for aggregation
- **Per-entity drag mode**: `defaultDragMode` on panels/containers/instances
- **Panel placement**: Position stored in `occurrence.placement` (not panel.row/col)
- **Iteration inheritance**: Grid → Panel → Container → Instance cascading
- **Compound iterations**: Time + Category filtering simultaneously

## Original Vision (Day Planner Explanation)

### What it is (in plain English)

A **drag-and-drop daily command center** where:
- You plan your day by **dragging tasks into time slots**
- You can also **track what you actually did**
- It can **calculate totals, streaks, progress, and stats automatically** from whatever you log

Think: **calendar + to-do list + habit tracker + budget/nutrition/workout tracker**, all in one.

### The big idea: "Anything you do can be measured"

A normal planner: "I did laundry ✅"

This planner:
- "I ran ✅ **for 25 minutes**"
- "I ate ✅ **42g protein**"
- "I saved ✅ **$20**"
- "I studied ✅ **2 pomodoros**"

Every task can be just a checkbox **or** a checkbox plus numbers/text.

### How scheduling works

**1) Build a "Task Bank"** - Your library of stuff you do (work, gym, meals, finance, routines)

**2) Drag tasks into your day** - Single task, multiple tasks, or preset bundles

**3) The schedule becomes your plan AND your log** - Same slots represent intent and reality

### How calculations work

The app calculates anything based on:
- **What task it was** (Protein vs Savings vs Meditation)
- **What value you entered** (42g, $20, 15 minutes)
- **What time "lens"** (Today, This week, This month)
- **What category filter** (Work only, Personal only, All)

So it can answer:
- "How much protein did I log **today**?"
- "How much did I save **this month**?"
- "How many **work** tasks did I complete **this week**?"
- "What's my streak for journaling?"

### One-liner

A **drag-and-drop day timeline** where every task can be a **checkbox or a measurement**, and the app can **sum/count/track progress across any time window AND category** without needing separate trackers.
