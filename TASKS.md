# TASKS — running queue

Maintained by Claude. Newest direction lands here first; the reasoning lives in
`CLAUDE_CHAT.md` and the plans under `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Open

| # | Task | State |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | **End-of-day move** — completed tasks/appointments → `Tasks > Completed` after the day rolls over, *"even if they arent on the schedule"* | 🔎 measured; blocked on repairing 2 mis-parented rows first |
| 2 | **"What else is technically needed for the original vision"** — asked 2026-08-21, never answered | 📋 open ask |
| 3 | **Empty panel → root manifest folder in folder view** — asked, no commit found | ❓ unconfirmed |
| 4 | **Schedule apply ~1s** — `resolveOptions` predicate filter ~766ms, the residual after the index work | 📋 measured, not fixed |
| 5 | **Three external-data pipes** — Tasker profiles, ingest credentials, the four slow exports | 🚫 blocked on the user |

## Done — 2026-08-21 (later)

| Task | Where |
|------|-------|
| **Theme sweep over every dropdown and menu** — 82 literal colours → tokens across 20 floating surfaces | `0e090a6b`, deployed |
| Theme tokens **verified resolving** on the live grid under Stardew — `--menu-shadow-1/2/3` brown (`rgba(52,31,14,…)`) not black, `--scrim` brown, `--signal-warn` darkened | browser probe |
| **Weekday feature VERIFIED IN A BROWSER** — the 2026-08-21 honest gap, closed | probe |
| **Merge templates as layers** — 7 day-templates → 6 reusable layers; `Place Weekday` merges every template whose `Weekday` contains the day. 56 duplicated meal rows → 8; stored rows 84 → 43 | `0177` |
| Today's column needed **no clear** — `0112` signs template rows by CONTENT (`cycle:<pick>`), so consolidating changes nothing a column matches on. Both ticked rows kept | measured |

## Done — 2026-08-21

| Task | Where |
|------|-------|
| Sidebar: Pinned and Root read as two sections | `6cabeeba` |
| Sidebar: Pinned stopped re-drawing the whole manifest (`Root` folder page) | `6cabeeba` |
| The day column's `Todo` had lost its identity marker — **due placement had been a silent no-op** | `0172` |
| `Weekday` on a task → a fresh copy on that weekday, every week | `0173` |
| Due placement yields to a weekday | `0173` |
| New occurrences inherit their siblings' fields, roles included | `12299b4f` |
| Field picker splits Display / Input into sections | `12299b4f` |
| Two inert `kind`s fixed at call sites the 2026-07-29 fix never reached | `12299b4f` |
| `--on-accent` / `--menu-shadow` tokens; the add menu reads the theme | `12299b4f` |
| Schedule snapped back to today (Aug 20 → Aug 21) so today's column rebuilds | data |
| **Both meal trackers were structurally dead** — macros and Meal Log | `0174` |
| `Time 1/2/3` (seconds) replace `Weight N` on planks and side planks; the bogus `1 reps` cleared | `0175` |
| `Date` hidden on timeslots — it was inherited-visible from the Schedule page's list | `0176` |
| Add-menu **value step** — the real field controls, every input type, not a hand-rolled subset | `49267930` |
| Ticked fields sort to the top of the field picker | `49267930` |
| `+ Item` was born with no date — it wrote `fields: {}` where the sibling path stamps the filter | `49267930` |
